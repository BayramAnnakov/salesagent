John: Hello, is this Bayram?

Bayram Annakov: Yes, speaking. Who is this?

John: Hey Bayram, I'm John from Prestige Jets. How's your day going?

Bayram Annakov: I'm quite busy, actually. What can I do for you?

John: Right, right, I'll be quick then. So, I was looking around, and I saw that you're doing some pretty big things in tech. Cool stuff, man. Anyway, I thought, "Hey, a guy like this probably needs to fly private, right?"

Bayram Annakov: I'm sorry, but who gave you this number?

John: Oh, we have our methods. Don't worry, it's all above board. So, about flying private. It's pretty awesome. You should totally get on board with it. No pun intended!

Bayram Annakov: I'm not currently interested in private jet services. Thank you for the call.

John: Wait, wait, don't hang up. You haven't even heard the best part. We've got the best jets, the best service. You know, we can even get a jet with gold-plated cup holders if that's your thing.

Bayram Annakov: I don't think this is relevant to me. And I'd appreciate it if you respected my privacy.

John: But dude, think about it. Flying commercial is such a hassle. You're a busy guy, right? Time is money. And with us, you could save so much time.

Bayram Annakov: I understand that, but I've already said I'm not interested. Please, let's not waste each other's time.

John: You're not getting it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime offer. I can get you a sweet deal, like, right now. But you gotta say yes right now.

Bayram Annakov: I'm sorry, but I'm not interested. And I don't appreciate this aggressive sales tactic.

John: Man, you're making a huge mistake. Huge. But alright, your loss. When you're stuck at an airport next time, remember this call.

Bayram Annakov: Goodbye, John.
